containers and algorithms, run: job

1. generate SSID, create outputdir: SSID-nameofoutput (a lot of times it is outDir)

cwl when provided outdir: it only takes folder name and generate folder name with that name

when create workflow:
specify output path where all the output data will get put
that output path will be fed to runtimecontext
we should use that rc for all plugins

for each clt we specify different set of outputs

specify output dir in plugins: relative, only dirname, if full path given: warning
specify output dir in pipeline

there is always a file copy that happens
cwl: bunch of tmpdir
then copies them into another dir specified in the output
multiple tb of data? no good

runtimecontext: let's use it to avoid it
make a note about this!!!
investigate zero copy cwl workflows
